# Sphere-Survival

Sphere Survival
I'm excited to present my latest project â€“ an immersive ball survival game developed using Unity and C#. In this game, players take control of a sphere character that must survive relentless waves of enemy spheres while navigating a treacherous platform.
Key Features:
Dynamic Waves of Enemies: With each new wave, the number of enemy spheres increases, constantly raising the challenge and keeping players on their toes.
Power-up Mechanics: Players can strategically utilize temporary power-ups that grant their sphere character enhanced knock power, allowing them to deflect enemy spheres more effectively. Each wave introduces a new power-up, indicated by a distinct marker, forcing players to adapt their tactics accordingly.
Immersive Camera Movement: The camera smoothly rotates 360 degrees, following the sphere's movements across the platform, ensuring players always have a clear view of the action, regardless of the sphere's orientation.
Engaging Gameplay Mechanics: Players must use their sphere character's knock power to deflect enemy spheres and prevent them from knocking their character off the cliff, ensuring an exhilarating and intense gameplay experience.
Throughout the development process, I honed my skills in Unity game engine, C# programming, camera control, and implementing engaging gameplay mechanics. This project challenged me to create a dynamic and responsive game environment, integrate power-up systems, and implement collision detection and game over logic.
I am thrilled with the result and look forward to continuing my journey in game development, exploring new techniques and ideas to create even more engaging and immersive gaming experiences.
Feel free to check out the project and provide any feedback or suggestions!
